FileMaker-Pro-Stuff
===================

A collection of icons for use in FIleMaker Pro layouts

The wonderful people at [pc.de](http://pc.de/icons/) made available a collection of icons. I went ahead and imported them into filemaker
as individual fields. So you can reference file "contact" to get a container image of a contect icon. I put in 10 sets.

So you can use this as a theam file, if you know what you are doing in FileMaker. 

If you feel like adding more wonderfulness, (more fields, more icon sets) please do let me know, send me a pull.

Now if only FileMaker files were not giant blobs of compiled bits!
